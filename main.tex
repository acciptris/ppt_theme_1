\title[Short Paper Title] % (optional, use only with long paper titles)
{Title As It Is In the Proceedings}

\subtitle
{Include Only If Paper Has a Subtitle}

\author[Author, Another] % (optional, use only with lots of authors)
{F.~Author\inst{1} \and S.~Another\inst{2}}
% - Give the names in the same order as the appear in the paper.
% - Use the \inst{?} command only if the authors have different

\institute[Universities of Somewhere and Elsewhere] % (optional, but mostly needed)
{
  \inst{1}%
  Department of Computer Science\\
  University of Somewhere

  \inst{2}%
  Department of Theoretical Philosophy\\
  University of Elsewhere}
% - Use the \inst command only if there are several affiliations.
% - Keep it simple, no one is interested in your street address.

\date[CFP 2003] % (optional, should be abbreviation of conference name)
{Conference on Fabulous Presentations, 2003}
% - Either use conference name or its abbreviation.
% - Not really informative to the audience, more for people (including
%   yourself) who are reading the slides online

% This is only inserted into the PDF information catalog. Can be left
% out.

% If you have a file called "university-logo-filename.xxx", where xxx

% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

              The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
        \item
              Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
